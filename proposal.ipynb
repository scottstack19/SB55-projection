Pages for each year readily contain team-based stats for the year as well as conference standings and results, which is the data that will be used to create models to make predictions. The intended method to obtain data will to be to scrape the site using the libraries [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) to create HTML files for each page and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to gather relevent data from each url.
